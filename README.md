Hi, I'm Razyeh Diba. I have a PhD in computational physics and have worked with micromagnetic simulation software OOMMF and vinamax.

I've learned bash scripting for running the simulations and data cleaning and learned Python for analyzing simulation data and machine learning techniques.

Different repositories (ML_projects, Java, BankCraft) include some of the projects I was working on.
