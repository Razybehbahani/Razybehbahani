Hi, I'm Razyeh (Rosie) Behbahani. I have a PhD in computational physics and have worked with micromagnetic simulation software OOMMF and vinamax.

I've learned bash scripting for running the simulations and data cleaning and learned Python for analyzing simulation data.

I've made different repositories to include some of the codes I've used for future references.
Repositories are: ML_projects, Java

I am also interested in Machine Learning and currently am working on ML research projects that are introduced in the ML repository. 

While learning Java in the context of data structures and algorithms, I have done small projects which are included in a repository named Java.
