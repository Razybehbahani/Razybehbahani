Hi, I'm Razyeh (Rosie) Behbahani. I studied comutational physics and experienced working with micromagnetic simulation software OOMMF and vinamax.
I've learned bash scripting for running the simulations and data cleaning and learned Python for analyzing simulation data.
I am also interested in Machine Learning and currently am working on a research project.
I've made different repositories to include some of the codes I've used for future references.
Repoditories are: ML - Bash - OOMMF - Vinamax
